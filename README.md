# Club Ralley

**Club Ralley** is a social platform for post-grad athletes looking to stay competitive, active, and connected after college. The app helps users discover recreational sports, fitness events, and workout classes while engaging with a community that values an active lifestyle over alcohol-centric socializing.

Think **LinkedIn meets Strava**, built specifically for life after organized athletics.

## The Problem

After college, many athletes lose:
- A built-in community and sense of camaraderie  
- Structured competition and routine  
- Social outlets that prioritize health and activity  

There is currently no single platform that combines **sports discovery**, **community**, and **social sharing** for this demographic.

---

## The Solution

Club Ralley reconnects former athletes with their athletic identity by providing a centralized hub for competition, fitness, and community.

### Core Features

- **Social Feed**  
  Share workouts, rec league updates, photos, and achievements.

- **Discovery**  
  Find and join leagues, classes, and events by location, sport, or skill level—or create your own.

- **Connections**  
  Meet teammates, grow your athletic network, and see what others nearby are playing.

- **Profiles**  
  Showcase achievements, participation history, and your active lifestyle.

## Target Market

- **Primary:** Post-grad athletes ages 22–35 transitioning out of college sports  
- **Secondary:** Fitness-oriented individuals ages 18–35 who enjoy team sports and active social events
